I created this quicky and handy application that will automatically create a default.ini file that holds the user's prefered plumbob colours.

HOW TO USE:
1. Run the .EXE
2. Pick your favourite plumbob colour combinations.
3. Click the "generate" button and save the file as "Default.ini" and place it in the Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\ConfigOverride directory (or where ever you set this folder up if using custom location)
4. (IMPORTANT, IT MUST BE SAVED AS "Default.ini" or it will not work!
5. Load your save and enjoy your new plumbob!

REQUIREMENTS:
Microsoft .NET 6
Windows OS (I have not tested on Mac OS)

CREDTS:
Owners of Haley colorpicker package
Sims 3
